# Sakura Cafe Website

Sakura Cafe is a popular Japanese restaurant located in Hazel Green, AL. After searching for their restaurant through Google, I noticed that they do not currently (as of 4/4/2021) have a website. I decided to apply the HTML and CSS knowledge I've acquired recently through FreeCodeCamp and the Odin Project to construct a website for them.
